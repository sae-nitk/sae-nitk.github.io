        "In the era of 4.0 technology, robotic arms are becoming more and more popular in modern industries. Today, every small and large industry uses the robotic manipulator to complete various tasks like picking and placing, welding process, painting, and material handling. Therefore, the research and simulation of robotic arms significantly improve the efficiency of using this tool in all sectors. The Unimation PUMA 560 serially linked robot manipulator was used as a basis because this robot manipulator is widely used in industry and academia. It has nonlinear and uncertain dynamic parameters serial link 6 degrees of freedom robot manipulator. The position and orientation of the robotic arm end-effector are generated by the Denavit Hartenburg method, and the inverse kinematics equations have been derived using the analytical method. Cubic and quintic polynomial interpolations have been used to study trajectory planning, and the Monte Carlo method is proposed to analyze the robotic arm's workspace.",

      title: "Active Suspension Using Matlab",
      description:
        "Vehicle suspension systems are typically rated by their ability to provide good road handling and better ride comfort. Current automobile suspension systems use passive components only by utilizing spring and damping coefficients with fixed rates. This system only offers a compromise between these two conflicting criteria. Spring and damper are used between the vehicle body and the wheel assembly in conventional passive suspensions. The parameters of the spring-damper are chosen to emphasize one of several conflicting interests, like passenger comfort, road handling, and suspension deflection. Using a feedback-controller hydraulic actuator between the body and wheel assembly, active suspensions allow the designer to balance these requirements. Active suspension controls the vertical wheel movement with an onboard system rather than determined only by the road profile. Team members were able to gain valuable experience in applying various concepts such as mathematical modeling, PID controllers, and the basics of H- infinity synthesis and MATLAB. However, the project still has a lot of scope for improvement in terms of improving the efficiency of the system and introducing various other aspects such as different control modes, etc.",

Velocity prediction module: In this module, we take the given radius of curvature of the road. Other factors such as slip angle and steering angle are calculated. Combining the calculated radius of curvature and the maximum speed for a safe turn is calculated. The maximum speed is displayed on the screen for assisting drivers or for calculating the safe speed for self-driving vehicles.",
