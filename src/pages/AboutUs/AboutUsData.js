        the very bright side of the technologies of the future and exhibits them to the institute

        to be a first for this club and NITK Surathkal. The Institute appreciates the work of 
        SAE-NITK and all its members and coordinators who have been working their to embellish the club.

        and has been doing incredible work all these years. For the first time, the club is bringing out a 
        magazine which aims at showcasing the developments that have been taking place in the field of 
        the Automotive sector, and I am sure it will help lots of people get to know about the activities 
        of SAE and also about technological advances in the field.
  
        The Members, Coordinators, and Faculty Advisors of SAE-NITK have been doing a great job. 
        The current Faculty Advisor Dr. Poornesh Kumar Koorata is mentoring the club very effectively, 
        and I firmly believe that under his mentorship the SAE-NITK club will reach several milestones 
        in the years to come. I wish them all the success.`,
